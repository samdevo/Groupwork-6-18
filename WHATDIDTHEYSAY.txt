WHAT DID THEY SAY SAM
they said that when the user inputs his/her numbers, they do it on one line. they do it by making a command that detects '/', '*', '+', etc. within the user input, then doing the respective operation.

You can use the include? method:

my_string = "abcdefg"
if my_string.include? "cde"
   puts "String includes 'cde'"
end
